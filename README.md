Spin up a dev server with live reload in just 8 letters.

## Installation

yarn global add ezreload
````

## Usage

Using ezreload is dead simple by design. All you need to do is : 

````bash
ezreload

And that's it. Your browser will automatically open, the web server will automatically start on an automatically selected port.
